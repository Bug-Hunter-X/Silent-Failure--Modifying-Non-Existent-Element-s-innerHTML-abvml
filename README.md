This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug involving the silent failure when trying to modify the `innerHTML` of a non-existent element.  The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.  The problem arises from attempting to access an element using `getElementById` that hasn't been defined in the HTML.  This results in a JavaScript error, but without a clear indication in the browser's console (depending on the browser's settings and error handling), making it difficult to detect.  The solution involves properly checking if the element exists before attempting any modifications.
